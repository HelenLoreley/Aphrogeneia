      title: "I. Prologue — Turbid Disorder Era",
      quote: "This atlas is not a map of places — it is a chart of vibrations, of the dimensions you have yet to climb.",
      content: "The Turbid Disorder Era was triggered by an inexplicable global atmospheric anomaly: a higher-dimensional membrane, later termed The Shroud, descended over the Earth. This phenomenon induced collective perceptual disorders, hallucinations, and information dissonance—later known as the Shroud Syndrome."

      title: "I.3 Frequency-Based Warfare",
      content: "The Turbid Warfare Protocol classifies cognitive weapons into three systemised categories: Frequency Jammers (destabilise neural coherence), Dislocation Bombs (target chronotopic coherence), and Affect Modulators (psychoactive carriers via urban surfaces)."

      content: "A Protocol for Post-Collapse Cognition and Synthetic Agency. Based on Cedric Price's Fun Palace concept, the physical framework uses modular steel structures. The Palace incorporates a layered signal architecture. Biosensory input—EEG, GSR, thermal feedback—drives changes in acoustic, visual, and olfactory fields.",
